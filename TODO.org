* TODO weighting matrix - linear eq. to transform stats to goal weights
* DONE defenders can stay put (but don't block spawners)
* DONE "plug own hill" goal? (want to eat food to prevent enemies but don't want too many ants)
* TODO reexpore goal - go back to squares we haven't seen in a while
* DONE replace chase goal with escort goal - more sophisticated tracking, reacquire moving target
can we use this same logic for hunting enemies?
* TODO avenge goal - head to dead ally
* TODO overrun goal - head to dead enemy
* TODO limit goal pursuit time - cache only a partial route then reacquire goal
* DONE simplify goal / route code - too many interdependencies
* TODO priority queue for ant movement - ants with most important / nearest goals get to go first in case we timeout
* TODO more aggressive local timeout - don't let the server time us out
* TODO index square types for destination generation
* TODO limit number of ants that can pursue a goal? i.e. don't have everyone chase the same food
* TODO cache long-lived routes? i.e. route to enemy hill
* TODO ants move as groups / formations
would it be so hard to make them move 1x2 or 2x2?
this can be a "smarter escort" goal
* TODO evolve on different map types and player counts
* TODO GA algorithm doesn't seem to actually work
* TODO invalidate routes when water is revealed on route square
* TODO escort inversion - if i'm escorting you, but i'm on the way to your goal, then you should be escorting me
* IN_PROGRESS make profilable
** DONE make runs deterministic w/r/t initial seed
** TODO add flag to ignore time budget
** TODO run a slow map with high timeout value, capture input, ensure no timeouts
** TODO rerun with same intput repeatedly under profiler
