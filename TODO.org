* DONE vector of environment statistics
** water / total space
** observed sq / total space
** unobserved sq / total space
** food / observed sq
** my ants / observed sq
** enemy ants / observed sq
** my hills / observed sq
** enemy hills / observed sq
* DONE weighting matrix - linear eq. to transform stats to goal weights
* DONE defenders can stay put (but don't block spawners)
* DONE "plug own hill" goal? (want to eat food to prevent enemies but don't want too many ants)
* DONE make profilable
** DONE make runs deterministic w/r/t initial seed
** DONE add flag to ignore time budget
** DONE run a slow map with high timeout value, capture input, ensure no timeouts
** TODO rerun with same input repeatedly under profiler
* DONE replace chase goal with escort goal - more sophisticated tracking, reacquire moving target
can we use this same logic for hunting enemies?
* DONE simplify goal / route code - too many interdependencies
* DONE run in strict orders mode and root out invalid orders (rare but they happen)
* DONE priority queue for ant movement - ants with most important / nearest goals get to go first in case we timeout
* DONE more aggressive local timeout - don't let the server time us out
* DONE GA algorithm doesn't seem to actually work
* DONE index square types for destination generation
* TODO patrol goal - go back to squares we haven't seen in a while
* TODO make it faster
* TODO avenge goal - head to dead ally
* TODO overrun goal - head to dead enemy
* TODO limit goal pursuit time - cache only a partial route then reacquire goal
* TODO limit number of ants that can pursue a goal? i.e. don't have everyone chase the same food
* TODO cache long-lived routes? i.e. route to enemy hill
* TODO ants move as groups / formations
would it be so hard to make them move 1x2 or 2x2?
this can be a "smarter escort" goal
* TODO evolve on different map types and player counts
* TODO invalidate routes when water is revealed on route square
* TODO escort inversion - if i'm escorting you, but i'm on the way to your goal, then you should be escorting me
* TODO process player elimination messages and update statistics
* TODO escort any goal, including escorts. don't think there's a real risk of cycles here
* TODO escort priority is a function of escortee's priority
Should it always be lower? How to incorporate escort's own column in the priority matrix?
* TODO shadow goal - move in formation with another adjacent ant
* TODO better capture state of dead ally / enemy
* TODO chokepoint goal - defend a point with few land squares within the fight radius (and high connectivity?)
maybe just look for a 2x1 or 3x1 with water on either side
