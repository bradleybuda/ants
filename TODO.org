* TODO make it faster
* TODO vector of environment statistics
** water / total space
** observed sq / total space
** unobserved sq / total space
** food / observed sq
** my ants / observed sq
** enemy ants / observed sq
** my hills / observed sq
** enemy hills / observed sq
* TODO weighting matrix - linear eq. to transform stats to goal weights
* TODO defenders can stay put (but don't block spawners)
* TODO "plug own hill" goal? (want to eat food to prevent enemies but don't want too many ants)
* TODO reexpore goal - go back to squares we haven't seen in a while
* TODO replace chase goal with escort goal - more sophisticated tracking, reacquire moving target
can we use this same logic for hunting enemies?
* TODO avenge goal - head to dead ally
* TODO overrun goal - head to dead enemy
* TODO limit goal pursuit time - cache only a partial route then reacquire goal
* TODO simplify goal / route code - too many interdependencies
* TODO priority queue for ant movement - ants with most important / nearest goals get to go first in case we timeout
* TODO more aggressive local timeout - don't let the server time us out
* TODO index square types for destination generation
* TODO limit number of ants that can pursue a goal? i.e. don't have everyone chase the same food
* TODO cache long-lived routes? i.e. route to enemy hill
* TODO invalidate routes when water is revealed on route square
* TODO ants move as groups / formations
would it be so hard to make them move 1x2 or 2x2?

* TODO evolve on different map types and player counts
